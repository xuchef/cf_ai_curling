## Curling DB Query Tool

> I have a sqlite db that I'd like to query from, how would I integrate that as a tool?

> I've populated my db with the data as defined here @tools.ts create a tool that executes queries against the db

> does the AI have context about the curling data? if not, can you add it?

> in the prompt, inject the whole DDL statements from the database

> get rid of the other tool calls and the base template functionality. I only want my curling query tool
